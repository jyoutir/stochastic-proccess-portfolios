This is a database of my portfolio projects created for the module SOR3012 (Stochastic Proccesses & Risk), 
taught by Dr. G A Tribello

This is a showcase of my work that is used to build my understanding of the module, building towards the final goal of modelling research for Fermanagh Community Transport.
